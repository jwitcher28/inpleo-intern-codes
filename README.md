# inpleo-intern-codes
My codes from my summer internship at Inpleo (2022) 


1. RPS (Rock, Paper, Scissors)   
  To begin the game I imported randint to allow the computer to generate random moves and used it to have the computer randomly choose from the 3 variables of the game (rock, paper, and scissors). I then made sure to have it print 'tie' if the computer and player moves were equal. After that, I used a series of if else statements for every possible move of the game. For each statement I first indicated the move that would cause the computer to win and coded to have it print a losing statement. This was followed with an else statement for if the player chose the winning move and a print which indicated such.  


2. Dog Assigner 
  The dog assigner is built using a plethora of if else statements which lead to a new set of if else questions correlating to the users previous response. I began intially with a generic question: Do you like going on walks? Yes or No? and from there branched off into more statements to deduce which of my selected dogs they most resembeled.


3. Drawing 
  The drawing code involves importing Turtle to create whatever drawings you would like. After importing it (pip (or pip 3) install PythonTurtle) and replace it with a variable - I used 't' - you are able to direct an arrow around in a pop up window to draw your image. To do such, use the commands t.forward(), t.right(), t.left(), replacing t with your variable. When moving forward, the number you enter into the parentheses determines the length of the line segment. When moving right or left, the number indicates the direction the arrow will turn to form the next line segment. My code creates a 3-D cube however, Turtle can be used for much more!
